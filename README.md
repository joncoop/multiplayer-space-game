# Multiplayer Space Game

This is a work in progress. The eventual goal is to have multiple players battle each other over a network.

## Ideas
- Black holes teleport ship. Touching black hole sucks you in. Ship spins while being sucked to center. Spins out of another black hole. Give a brief time to accelerate out.
- Propegate powerups in center of the world at random intervals. Shoot them out in random directions, but make them fade out. Force players to center for needed powerups to create a combat area so ships can't hide. Perhaps fuel and ammo. Maybe emit them from some kind of pular.
- Prettier star backdrop. (Easy)
- Shooting asteroids breaks them into smaller pieces. Smallest ones dissapear.
- Add animated fire when ship is using thruster. (Easy, just overlay ship and fire image.)
- Speedboost powerup that gives 3 boosts (like Mario Kart mushrooms).
- Double-shot powerup.
- Shield powerup.
- Forcefield powerup.
- Shoot asteroids to spawn minerals to "mine".
