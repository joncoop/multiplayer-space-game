# Multiplayer Space Game

This is a work in progress. The eventual goal is to have multiple players battle each other over a network.

## Ideas
- Propegate powerups in center of the world at random intervals. Shoot them out in random directions, but make them fade out. Force players to center for needed powerups to create a combat area so ships can't hide. Perhaps fuel and ammo. Maybe emit them from some kind of pulsar. (Hunger games style)
- Prettier star backdrop. (Easy)
- Add animated fire when ship is using thruster. (Easyish, just overlay ship and fire image. Animate to be cooler.)
- Speedboost powerup that gives 3 boosts (like Mario Kart mushrooms).
- Double-shot powerup.
- Shield/health powerup.
- Forcefield powerup.
- Shooting asteroids breaks them into smaller pieces. Smallest ones dissapear.
- Shoot big asteroids to spawn minerals to "mine", randomly generated.
- Add gravity to black holes.
- Rate limit ship shooting.
- Deal with lasers and asteroids hitting ship while stuck in black hole.
- Make the universe round? Perhaps with a thick, starry border?
- Delta time this, seriously. No more counting frames. Oh, shut up. Frame counting is so easy. But for real. Try to do it right.
- Obviously this game needs epic sound effects and music.


## So...?
What about loading stuff when joining the network? Do i need bigger packet sizes then?
During game play, just send positions? What about long lists like bullets and asteroids?
Do other people use GitHub READMEs as random train of thought idea lists?
